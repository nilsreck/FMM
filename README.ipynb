    "# Reproducibility Study\n",
    "This repository contains the Snakemake project of our reproducibility study of the Bioinformatics paper\n",
    "\"A functional analysis of omic network embedding spaces reveals key altered functions in cancer\" by Doria-Belenguer et al. The original\n",
    "paper can be found [here](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/5/btad281/7135836?login=false). Snakemake is a workflow tool developed by [Felix Mölder et al.](https://f1000research.com/articles/10-33/v1). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Availability \n",
    "The following files: `Human_Biogrid_Adj_PPI_.npy`, `_Matrix_Genes_GO_BP_PPI.csv`, `enriched_in_cancer_gobp_terms_cosmic.txt`, \n",
    "corresponding to the human PPI network, the GO BP annotations, and the semantic similarity of the GO BP terms, respectively, used in this project \n",
    "can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SlZ1QixgQu0DoCJabR_cMzjiJv6aM7Pr).\n",
    "For reasons of reproducibility, we have saved the data from the original paper in a separate Google drive folder. \n",
    "Please donwload these files first and move them to the `Data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameters\n",
    "The pipeline takes a few parameters, most of which are set to replicate the results Doria Belenguer et al. . These Parameters can be found in a configuration file at \"workflow/config.yaml\" . Because this pipeline was created in the scope of a reproducibility study, some parameters will not function, as the original code was erroneous and we only fixed those parameter choices that copy the results by the original authors.\n",
    "Note that the necessary parameter \"NCBI_account\" is empty. To successfully execute the script, this has to be filled with an email linked to an NCBI account. \\\\\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "This pipeline requires four different environments. Yaml files can be found in the \"envs\" folder. However, only the \"snakemake.yaml\" needs to be created manually to execute this pipeline. The other two will be created automatically during runtime upon the first execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Requirements\n",
    "This pipeline was designed for cluster execution. To configure cluster specific job allocation methods, open the config file found at \"workflow/profiles/default/config.yaml\". See the [snakemake cluster execution](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/v7.19.1/executing/cluster.html) and [snakemake profiles](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executing/cli.html#) for further details on how to set this up. Each step of the workflow has different computational requirements that can be found in workflow/rules/steps.smk. The range of required resources reaches from 1 to 8 parallel processes with up to 32 GB of memory. Additionally, the results will take up about 8 additional GB of disc space, and one process requires access to the NCBI website using this URL \"https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution\n",
    "To exucute the pipeline, use conda activate snakemake (the environment found in snakemake.yaml) and enter the workflow directory. The pipeline can then simply be activated by typing \"snakemake\" to the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "The results will be copied into the \"Results/\" directory. \n",
    "Those consist of the prediction table and results from different statistical analyses:\n",
    "+ The prediction tables $\\text{(Predictions\\_Rank\\_{tissue}.csv)}$ are sorted by predictive confidence and entail the amount of literature validated occurences of the corresponding gene. These are produced by rule \"eval_predictions\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{Fold\\_Rank\\_Table\\_Dos.txt}$ contains the results of a statistical test using the hypergeometric distribution where the H0-hypothesis is \"those genes, that change their distance to moving/stable annotations the most/least, are not enriched/depleted in literature validated cancer-genes\". The resulting table contains the number of such genes and the p-value in brackets. This is produced by rule \"eval_predictions\". \n",
    "+ $\\text{Network\\_Statistics.txt}$ contains details for each gene network. This is produced by rule \"calculate_networks\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{Venn\\_Diagrams\\_Networks.svg}$ shows the amount of overlap between the different gene networks for each tissue. This is produced by rule \"calculate_networks\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{Relative\\_Error\\_Leaf.svg}$ shows the effects of increasing dimensionality for the embedding spaces on the FMM Matrices. The original authors use this to deduce the optimal dimensionality where the relative error stops declining. This is produced by rule \"eval_optimal_dimensionality\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{cancer\\_enrichments\\_2std.svg}$ shows cancer-relatedness of annotations grouped by their movement between the embedding spaces for cancer and control tissues. This shows that this movement is indeed correlated to annotations adopting cancer functions. This is produced by rule \"eval_movements\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{movement\\_evaluation.txt}$ shows the results of two statistical evaluations of movement. The first is a Mann–Whitney U test using movement of known cancer-related annotations (calculated by the original authors) and annotations that are not. The file used for these is \"enriched_in_cancer_gobp_terms_cosmic.txt\". The second Test is using a Hypergeometric distribution to do the same evaluation; H0-hypothesis being \"High annotation movement is un-correlated to cancer-relatedness\". This file is produced by rule \"eval_movemants\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{Functional\\_Organization\\_Leaf\\_Common\\_Set.svg}$ shows semantic similarity between annotations closely together (Similar) and annotations far apart (Dissimilar) within the embedding spaces. This portrays that biological functionality is captured by distances in this embedding space. This is produced by rule \"eval_functional_organization_1\".\n",
    "+ $\\text{Organization\\_Common\\_Space.txt}$ contains a table with the results of another Mann–Whitney U test. The two groups here are distances for each gene to belonging annotations and non-belonging annotations. This is produced by rule \"eval_functional_organization\".\n",
